//ITERATION 1
// createCard function
// evaluateGuess, see if it matches with answer
// return incorrect or correct

//ITERATION 2
//=====DECK=========
/*What - what data do I have?
//createDeck function
    //an array of objects
        //object has question (string), 
        //answers (array of strings),
        //correctAnswer (string)
//*Want - what do I want to do with that data?
    //take the array and create an object of objects
        //why? - Sarah saw this right away
//*How - How will I make this happen?
    //iterate over the deckArray and create an object of objects
//*Methods - What methods will I need to make that happen?*/
//forEach or map?
//How do I determine which one

//========ROUND========

//*What - what data do I have?
//createRound - is this a function?
//round should be an object
//organizes guess and records if they are correct or incorrect
// has a key value pair for the deck object

//*Want - what do I want/need to do with that data?
//*How - How will I make that happen?
//*Methods - What methods will I need to make that happen?
// create round object
// deck property
// currentCard property that takes in first card of deck array

// takeTurns property that starts as 0
// incorrectGuesses to store guesses in array

// takeTurn to increment turns, evaluates guesses, gives feedback and stores id of incorrect guesses

// calculatePercentCorrect(round) calculates and returns the percentage of correct guesses

//endRound(round) prints Round over! You answered ### of the questions correctly
